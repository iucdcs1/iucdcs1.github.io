                            <p>The Atonement is a game created using game engine Unity with internal C# programming language. The most difficult parts of development are pathfinding system (AI) and game/level-design.</p>
                            <p>The plot of the game revolves around the main character - a relatively ordinary, average person who suffers from constantly haunting nightmares in which he sees himself as the protagonist of various fairy tales that always end badly for the character.</p>
                            <p>The dreams in which he participates characterize the sins or actions he has committed throughout his life, and their list is not so small - greed, pride, envy, anger, despair.</p>
                            <p>This list can be continued for a long time, but whether the hero will be able to get rid of the nightmares that torment him and cleanse himself of his deeds or not - you will have to find out during the game.</p>
