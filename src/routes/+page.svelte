                <div class="about__text">
                    <p>My name is Daniil Vasilev. I am currently a third-year student at Innopolis University, specializing in backend development, distributed systems, and cybersecurity. My technical background includes experience in server-side development with Go and Python, as well as working with databases such as PostgreSQL and MongoDB using ORM tools like GORM and SQLAlchemy.</p>

                    <p>I have contributed to several projects where I was responsible for building REST APIs, implementing user authentication with JWT, and integrating asynchronous services using RabbitMQ and WebSockets. I also have experience with inter-service communication via gRPC. My development workflow includes containerization with Docker and Docker Compose, and I have explored orchestration tools such as Kubernetes. In a recent project, I developed a system that manages business operations, supports real-time notifications, and integrates with third-party services like Google Forms and Google Calendar.</p>

                    <p>I am particularly interested in high-load, distributed systems and the application of modern DevOps practices and security principles. My goal is to design and implement scalable, efficient, and secure backend solutions using contemporary technologies.</p>
