                                        <p>The Atonement is a game created using game engine Unity with internal C# programming language. The most difficult parts of development are pathfinding system (AI) and game/level-design.</p>
                                        <p>The plot of the game revolves around the main character - a relatively ordinary, average person who suffers from constantly haunting nightmares in which he sees himself as the protagonist of various fairy tales that always end badly for the character.</p>
                                        <p>The dreams in which he participates characterize the sins or actions he has committed throughout his life, and their list is not so small - greed, pride, envy, anger, despair.</p>
                                        <p>This list can be continued for a long time, but whether the hero will be able to get rid of the nightmares that torment him and cleanse himself of his deeds or not - you will have to find out during the game.</p>

                            <p>I am a young student of Innopolis University. I was born and raised in Saint Petersburg, Russia, where have graduated from the Saint Petersburg Academic Gymnasium â„–56. I has always been interested in technology, particularly in front-end web development and information security so I`m passionate about creating user-friendly and visually appealing websites that are also secure and reliable.</p>
                            <p>My dedication to learning and improving my skills is evident in my achievements. I have completed several courses in Python/Java programming languages, which have given me a solid foundation in this popular languages. I also have experience working with Django and Spring frameworks, and have knowledge in database management. These skills have allowed me to work on complex projects that require a deep understanding of web development and programming.</p>
                            <p>Currently, I am working on two exciting projects. The first is a tourism mobile app named KazanTravel, which has some similarities with TripAdvisor. This app will allow users to discover new places to visit, read reviews from other travelers, and plan their trips with ease. The second project is a portfolio website for my frontend web development course at the university. This website will showcase my skills and projects to potential employers and clients.</p>
